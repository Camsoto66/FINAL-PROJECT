            <h2>Cool Frog Facts</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>There are more than 7,000 species of frogs around the world.</li>
                <li>Frogs don’t drink water — they absorb it through their skin.</li>
                <li>Some frogs can jump over 20 times their body length.</li>
                <li>The glass frog has transparent skin, so you can see its organs.</li>
                <li>Poison dart frogs are brightly colored to warn predators they are toxic.</li>
                <li>Frogs start life as tadpoles and go through metamorphosis.</li>
                <li>Some frogs can freeze solid in winter and survive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Frogs Are Important</h2>
            <p>
                Frogs help control insect populations and are an important part of the food chain.
                Scientists also study frogs because their sensitive skin makes them early warning signs
                of environmental problems.

        <h2>Basic Frog Facts</h2>
        <p>
            Frogs are amphibians, which means they live part of their lives in water and part on land.
            They belong to a group of animals called <strong>Anura</strong>, which means “without a tail.”
            Adult frogs do not have tails, but their young form, called tadpoles, do.

        <h2>The Frog Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>
            Frogs go through a process called <em>metamorphosis</em>, which is a major change in body form.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong> – Frogs lay eggs in water or moist environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Tadpole</strong> – The young hatch with tails and gills for breathing underwater.</li>
            <li><strong>Growing legs</strong> – Hind legs appear first, then front legs.</li>
            <li><strong>Young frog</strong> – Lungs develop and the tail shrinks.</li>
            <li><strong>Adult frog</strong> – Fully adapted to life on land and water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Unique Frog Abilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sticky tongues:</strong> Frogs catch insects with fast, sticky tongues.</li>
            <li><strong>Powerful jumping:</strong> Some frogs can jump more than 20 times their body length.</li>
            <li><strong>Skin breathing:</strong> Frogs can absorb oxygen through their skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Camouflage:</strong> Many frogs blend into their surroundings to avoid predators.</li>
            <li><strong>Poison defenses:</strong> Some species have toxic skin to protect themselves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frogs Around the World</h2>
        <p>
            Frogs live on every continent except Antarctica. There are over 7,000 known species,
            and they come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The smallest frogs are less than half an inch long.</li>
            <li>The largest frog, the Goliath frog, can grow over 12 inches long.</li>
            <li>Tree frogs have special toe pads for climbing.</li>
            <li>Desert frogs survive dry conditions by burrowing underground.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Frogs Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Frogs are important to ecosystems because they help control insect populations and serve
            as food for birds, fish, and other animals. Scientists also study frogs to understand
            environmental changes, since their sensitive skin makes them vulnerable to pollution
            and climate changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Around the world, many frog species are declining. Protecting clean water and natural
            habitats helps ensure that frogs continue to play their important role in nature.
