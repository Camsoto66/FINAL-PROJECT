            <h2>Common Frog Habitats</h2>

            <h3>Ponds and Lakes</h3>
            <p>
                Many frogs live near freshwater like ponds, lakes, and wetlands.
                These areas provide water for laying eggs and plenty of insects to eat.
            </p>

            <h3>Rainforests</h3>
            <p>
                Tropical rainforests are home to some of the most colorful and unique frogs.
                These environments are warm, humid, and full of plants for climbing and hiding.
            </p>

            <h3>Forests and Grasslands</h3>
            <p>
                Some frogs live on land in forests or grassy areas, staying near moisture
                and returning to water when it’s time to breed.
            </p>

            <h3>Underground and Desert Areas</h3>
            <p>
                A few special frogs can survive in dry environments by burrowing underground
                and staying dormant until rain arrives.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Habitat Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Frogs need clean water and healthy environments to survive.
                Pollution, habitat loss, and climate change are major threats to frog populations worldwide.

        <h2>Where Frogs Live</h2>
        <p>
            Frogs live in many different environments around the world. Because their skin must stay
            moist, most frogs live near water or in humid areas. Different species have adapted to
            survive in ponds, forests, grasslands, and even deserts.

        <h2>Ponds, Lakes, and Wetlands</h2>
        <p>
            Freshwater habitats are the most common homes for frogs. Ponds, marshes, and wetlands
            provide safe places for frogs to lay eggs and for tadpoles to grow.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Still water protects eggs from strong currents</li>
            <li>Wet plants provide shelter from predators</li>
            <li>Large insect populations provide food</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rainforests</h2>
        <p>
            Tropical rainforests are home to many colorful and unique frog species. These environments
            are warm, humid, and full of trees and plants for climbing and hiding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tree frogs use sticky toe pads to move through branches, and some species even lay their
            eggs on leaves above water.
        </p>

    <div class="section" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <h2>Forests and Grasslands</h2>
        <p>
            Some frogs live mostly on land in forests or grassy areas. They stay close to damp soil,
            fallen leaves, or shaded areas to keep their skin from drying out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even land-dwelling frogs usually return to water during breeding season.
        </p>

    <div class="section" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <h2>Deserts and Dry Areas</h2>
        <p>
            Although frogs need moisture, a few species have adapted to very dry environments.
            These frogs survive by burrowing underground and entering a dormant state until rain arrives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>They store moisture in their bodies</li>
            <li>They stay underground for months or even years</li>
            <li>They emerge quickly after rainfall to breed</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <h2>Why Habitat Protection Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Frogs depend on clean water and healthy environments to survive. Habitat loss, pollution,
            and climate change are major threats to frog populations around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Protecting wetlands, reducing pollution, and preserving natural areas helps frogs and
            many other species that share the same ecosystems.
