      <h2>What Do Frogs Eat?</h2>
      <p>
        Most frogs are carnivores, meaning they eat other animals. They usually eat small creatures
        they can catch and swallow whole. Frogs do not chew their food. Instead, they rely on quick
        reflexes and sticky tongues to capture prey.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Foods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Insects (flies, crickets, beetles)</li>
        <li>Worms</li>
        <li>Snails and slugs</li>
        <li>Spiders</li>
        <li>Small fish (for larger frogs)</li>
        <li>Other small amphibians or even small mice (for very large species)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Fun fact:</strong> A frog’s tongue can snap out and grab prey in less than a second!

      <h2>What Do Tadpoles Eat?</h2>
      <p>
        Tadpoles have a very different diet from adult frogs. Most young tadpoles are herbivores
        or omnivores. They spend their time grazing on algae and plant material in the water.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Algae</li>
        <li>Soft aquatic plants</li>
        <li>Decaying organic matter</li>
        <li>Small microorganisms</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As tadpoles grow and begin developing legs, some species gradually shift toward eating
        small insects and animal matter.

      <h2>How Frogs Catch Their Food</h2>
      <p>
        Frogs are ambush predators. They usually sit still and wait for prey to come close.
        When an insect moves within range, the frog quickly launches its sticky tongue outward.
        The tongue is attached at the front of the mouth, allowing it to flip outward with great speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frogs also use their eyes to help swallow. When they blink, their eyes push downward,
        helping force food into the throat.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Science fact:</strong> Frogs swallow using their eyes! Blinking actually helps push food down.

      <h2>Why Diet Matters</h2>
      <p>
        A healthy diet is important for frog survival. Frogs help control insect populations,
        including mosquitoes and agricultural pests. Because they eat many different small animals,
        frogs play an important role in keeping ecosystems balanced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pollution and habitat loss can reduce the number of insects and other prey available.
        When food sources disappear, frog populations often decline as well.
